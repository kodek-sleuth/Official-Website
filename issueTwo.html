                    7 Advantages You Probably Don’t Know About Switching To Mac From PC
                </h1>
    
                <p id="firstParagraph">
                    The idea of switching to a Mac computer after being a PC 
                    user is a common temptation, but many folks haven’t 
                    made the jump because either it costs too much or 
                    there is too much invested in a PC system. Other folks 
                    believe they would have to recreate all their files, recreating
                    tons of data in a different format. With today’s technology that 
                    challenge is a bit of myth now, but it’s still enough to 
                    hold people back. However, here are some interesting reasons
                    why a switch might be a really good idea.
                </p>

                <h3 class="subHeaderText">1. The Operating System Got a Lot Better</h3><br>
                <p id="secondParagraph">
                    OS X for Apple was a gamechanger. 
                    Prior to that point, the operating system didn’t
                    really work with any other system and wasn’t meant to.
                    Whether it was Linux or PC, the Apple OS was simply incompatible 
                    territory. Then OS X came out and suddenly Apple computers became 
                    professional machines instead of hobbyist packages.       
                </p>

                <h3 class="subHeaderText">2. The Mac Mini</h3><br>
                <p id="thirdParagraph">
                    The release of the Mini revolutionized the desk space. 
                    No longer was there this clunky processor unit taking
                    up a fourth of the desk. This Mini thing instead appeared 
                    and worked just fine with everything plugged into it. 
                    It worked, it was functional, and it was dependable. 
                    Not to mention, people started realizing the Mac was
                    a far safer computer to work with. The big bad world 
                    of the Internet generally wrote viruses for PC computers, not Apple
                </p>

                <h3 class="subHeaderText">3. Apples Don’t Need Drivers</h3><br>
                <p id="fourthParagraph">
                    Say what? For anyone who has had to fuss with
                    Windows or re-installing that software, 
                    drivers are the bread and butter of the package. 
                    When the wrong drivers are present, bad things happen. 
                    So it can be a guessing game and a pain to get things
                    working again correctly. With an Apple, however, 
                    there’s no need for drivers because an Apple computer
                    had its software built into the hardware. Ergo, there’s
                    no need to keep fussing with drivers and updates.
                </p>

                <h3 class="subHeaderText">4. Cost</h3><br>
                <p id="fifthParagraph">
                    You Get What You Pay For – Yes, 
                    Apple computers cost more, 
                    but they don’t drop to $10 in value a few years later.
                    Instead, Apple computers keep quite a bit of their value
                    and people still want them used. This is because they are 
                    simply built better with quality materials. Instead of a 
                    plastic case, they have an aluminum one. Instead of cheap circuitry, 
                    their computers are built to withstand use and keep going. 
                    Instead of feeling like one is carrying a suitcase, 
                    Apple laptops are built for comfort and low weight demands.
                    When you add up all these factors, the cost doesn’t seem so 
                    expensive for what one is getting in a computer.
                    It’s a bit like comparing an economy car from Ford versus a 
                    mid-line Toyota.    
                </p>

                <h3 class="subHeaderText">5. Portability</h3><br>
                <p id="sixthParagraph">
                    With the Apple system flowing back and forth
                    between the Mac, the iPhone, and the iPad, 
                    a user’s portability of information is at a maximum.
                    Apple set the standard for smart devices, and 
                    while there are competitors, Apple devices are still 
                    sought after as the best version on the market.
                    And they don’t have a problem with hacks and virus sharing, 
                    at least not near as bad as PC systems do.
