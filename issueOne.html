                    Windows wins the desktop, but Linux takes the world

                    The city with the highest-profile Linux desktop projects is turning back to Windows, but the fate of Linux isn't tied to the PC anymore.

                <p id="firstParagraph">
                    After a nearly decade-long project to move away from Windows onto
                    Linux, Munich has all but decided on a dramatic u-turn.
                    It's likely that, by 2021, the city council will start to replace PCs 
                    running LiMux (its custom version of Ubuntu) with Windows 10.
                </p>

                <p id="secondParagraph">
                    Going back maybe 15 or 20 years, 
                    it was seriously debated as to when Linux would overtake 
                    Windows on the desktop. When Ubuntu was created in 2004, 
                    for example, it was with the specific intention of replacing 
                    Windows as the standard desktop operating system.
                    Spoiler: it didn't happen.
                </p>

                <p id="thirdParagraph">
                    Linux on the desktop has about a two percent market 
                    share today and is viewed by many as complicated 
                    and obscure. Meanwhile, Windows sails on serenely,
                    currently running on 90 percent of PCs in use. 
                    There will likely always be a few Linux desktops around
                    in business -- particularly for developers or data scientists.
                    But it's never going to be mainstream.
                </p>

                <p id="fourthParagraph">
                    There has been lots of interest in Munich's 
                    Linux project because it's one of the biggest around. 
                    Few large organizations have switched from Windows to 
                    Linux, although there are some others,
                    like the French Gendarmerie and the city of Turin.
                    But Munich was the poster child: losing it as 
                    a case study will undoubtedly be a blow to those 
                    still championing Linux on the desktop.
                    But the reality is that most companies 
                    are happy to go with the dominant desktop OS,
                    given all of the advantages around integration 
                    and familiarity that come with it.
